    title: About Me
    summary: |
      I am currently a Ph.D student at [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu/) working with Prof. [Jia-Bin Huang](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~jbhuang/). I obtained my M.S. degree from [UC San Diego](http://www.ece.ucsd.edu/), advised by Prof. [Nuno Vasconcelos](http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/~nuno/), and my B.E. degree from [South China University of Technology (SCUT)](https://en.scut.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Junbo Zhang](https://sdgc.stanford.edu/person/junbo-zhang), respectively.
      
      My current research interests include generative models and their applications. I used to work on the scene understanding for Self-Driving. My CV is available [here](../assets/images/Yiran_CV.pdf).
